# QUESTION: How does time of the year affect the amount of violation tickets issued, and is this affected by the weather and temperature for each month?
- It appears that for most of the months, there does not seem to be a significant pattern for how violation tickes between month by month. 
Though there is a huge spike in violation tickets in January, and there is a slight dip in December.
- There does not appear to be much of a connection between temperature and parking violations.
- Interestingly, there is a bit of a dip of parking violations in July, the month with the most precipitation, while June has on average more violations and less precipitation
- January has the largest percentage of violations out of all of the months.

# QUESTION: How does the day of the week affect the amount of violations, and whether it differs among seasons?
- Violations are lowest on Sunday, and steadily increases until it peaks on Wednesday, and then steadily decreases for the rest of the week.
- Total violations are about the same for each of the seasons, though average violations are a tiny bit higher for the winter. 
- - This may be due to fact there is a massive spike in January counts, and a slight dip in December counts.

# PROBLEMS and whatnot
- Weather data is based on the data from the National Arborem
- The data is missing timestamps for many of the entries, so we did not examine how violations differ throughout the day. 
- The data includes "TICKET_ISSUE_DATE" which is the date when the ticket was issued, rather than when the violation was committed.
Thus what we're looking at is more of how officers change their ticket giving behavior, rather than the violators themselves.
